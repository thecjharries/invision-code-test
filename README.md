## Dev Log

* 1434: Wasted 45 minutes trying to figure out why the server wasn't working period (first in TS then in vanilla JS); I forgot a `/`. That's what I get for trying to rewrite instead of just using copypasta.
* 1443: Pulling regex for URLs from https://stackoverflow.com/a/6041965/2877698; may or may not work.
