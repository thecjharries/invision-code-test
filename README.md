# `invision-code-test`

Repo containing code for InVision's code test.

## Plan

* Figure out method of attack - done 1446
* Understand webhooks (never built my own webhook app but used many) - 1320
* Set up server ot handle webhooks - 1434
* Parse URLs from desc
* Understand bot comments on GitHub (literally never touched in my life other than some reddit commenting bots research in Python years ago)
* Figure out bot code and setup
* Post comment
* Comment everything possible
* Test

## Dev Log

* 1434: Wasted 45 minutes trying to figure out why the server wasn't working period (first in TS then in vanilla JS); I forgot a `/`. That's what I get for trying to rewrite instead of just using copypasta.
* 1443: Pulling regex for URLs from https://stackoverflow.com/a/6041965/2877698; may or may not work.
